# Find a team

Yes, it is possible to do it all by yourself but it is a lot easier if you don't. 4 - 6 is a good number :)

Please keep in mind that the more people you are the larger the communication issues might get.

## Communication

Communication is everything!

Choose your tools of communication wisely. If they don't work change them. Talk about it.

This is our toolchain:

- We use *slack* for daily communication issues.
- We meet or use *google hangout* every 4-6 weeks to keep each other updated.
- We use *google drive* for all documentation.
- We use *trello* for progress overview.

## Responsibilities

We extracted the following more or less independent topics / responsibilities:
* Sponsoring
* Location
* Tickets
* Party
* Catering
* Website
* Social Media + PR
* Design
* Insurance
* Swag: T-Shirts, Badges, Stickers, etc
* Finance
* Diversity
* CoC

At the Kick-off Meeting every topic is assigned to one or two team members who have the full responsibility.

Some topics overlap. So there must be some communication between the teams.

## Retrospective

Each year after the conference we meet for a Retrospective / PMA regarding the process and the actual conference. We invite an external moderator to oversee the meeting.
The goal of this meeting is to check what went good and what can be improved for the next time.

Simply put: we want to learn from our mistakes to improve each year in a nicely Kaizen matter.
