# Find a team

Yes, it is possible to do it all by yourself but it is a lot easier if you don't. 4 - 6 is a good number :)

Please keep in mind that the more people you are the larger the communication issues might get.

## Communication

Communication is everything!

Choose your tools of communication wisely. If they don't work change them. Talk about it.

This is our toolchain:

- We use *slack* for daily communication issues.
- We meet or *skype* every 4-6 weeks to keep each other updated.
- We use *google drive* for all documentation.
- We use *trello* for progress overview.

## Responsibilities

We extracted the following more or less independent topics / responsibilities:
* Sponsoring
* Locations
* Tickets
* Party
* Catering
* Website
* Social Media + PR
* Design
* Insurance
* Swag: T-Shirts, Badges, Stickers, etc
* Finance
* Diversity
* CoC

At the Kick-off Meeting every topic is assigned to one or two team members who have the full responsibility.
