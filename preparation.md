# Pre-conference preparation

## Find a team

Yes, it is possible to do it all by yourself but it is a lot easier if you don't. 4 - 6 is a good number :)

Please keep in mind that the more people you are the larger the communication issues might get.

## Financing

We were in the lucky position that we know a registered friendly society which handles the money.

I suggest to find something like this as well, find a company as sponsor which can handle the finances, or found a company / society so that you don't have to handle the finances on your private account.

## What do you want to do!

The most important thing before you can start planning and organizing is to know what you want to do.

And this means on the one hand how many people shall attend (this is important not only for the location but also for the business plan) and on the other hand what shall the conference format be.

For example: we as an unconference decided a while ago that we want:
* 3 tracks with 30 minutes talks and 15 minutes breaks
* therefore 3 halls
* at least one hall big enough to fit everyone in there
* a large space in front of the track halls where the participants can spend their time between the talks, talk to sponsors, drink a coffee or spend time on their computer. This space is also used for catering.

## Communication

Communication is everything!

Choose your tools of communication wisely. If they don't work change them. Talk about it.

This is our toolchain:

- We use *slack* for daily communication issues.
- We meet or *skype* every 4-6 weeks to keep each other updated.
- We use *google drive* for all documentation.
- We use *trello* for progress overview.

## Very rough roadmap

We recommend to have a very rough roadmap with events that need to be done at a certain time.

Ideally add a specific time or month to each of these steps to check if you are still on time.
