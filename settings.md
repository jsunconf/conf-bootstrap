# What do you want to do?

The most important thing before you can start planning and organizing is to know what you want to do.

And this means on the one hand how many people shall attend (this is important not only for the location but also for the business plan) and on the other hand what shall the conference format be.

For example: we as an unconference decided a while ago that we want:
* 3 tracks with 30 minutes talks and 15 minutes breaks
* therefore 3 hallsÌ¨
* at least one hall big enough to fit everyone in there
* a large space in front of the track halls where the participants can spend their time between the talks, talk to sponsors, drink a coffee or spend time on their computer. This space is also used for catering.

Other examples:

 - single track conference with curated schedule, 200 attendees, 2 days
 - single track mini-conference, 1 day, 100 attendees, second part of the day workshops run by attendees

It's your conference! The concept you have for your event will influence the amount of required work to organize the event. It will also influence the atmosphere of the event.

 - type of the conference (e.g. single track classic conference, multi-track, Unconference)
 - the planned size (cozy vs very big)
 - length (half-day vs 5 days)
 - things that make the conference unique and more awesome

Smaller events are usually a bit easier to organize.
