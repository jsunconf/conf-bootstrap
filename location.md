# Date and location

## Dates

### How to choose a date?

- Check other events you don't want to interfere with
 - when are competitor conferences?
 - check in your country / city and your continent
- Check other events in your city
 - avoid fairs or sport competitions as the accommodations are booked and more expensive)
- Check your holidays! Especially in the end there will be a lot work to do. So in the best case no long holidays away from the internet the month before the conference.


### Selection

Have a selection of dates available that you can use for choosing
locations.

## Locations

Depending on the conference setup and type your needs for a location
will change.

The type of location depends on:

 - the amount of attendees
 - conference tracks
 - extra rooms for workshops and child care
 - space for sponsors

For an Unconference around 3 tracks in parallel worked out well for
us. We also have 300-400 attendees.

For the Unconf we visited many locations in Hamburg. For Unconferences
universities work great. They have many lecture rooms, pre-equipped
with projectors and sound equipment. Sometimes you can get a better
price in return for free tickets for students.

Smaller events don't need that much space. They can also happen in the
rooms of a sponsoring company.
