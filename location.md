## Dates

### How to choose a date?

- Check other events you don't want to interfere with
 - when are competitor conferences?
 - check in your country / city and your continent
- Check other events in your city
 - avoid fairs or sport competitions as the accommodations are booked and more expensive)
- Check your holidays! Especially in the end there will be a lot work to do. So in the best case no long holidays away from the internet the month before the conference.
