# Date and location

You need some dates to ask the location for them. So first step is to find a date for your conference.

# Dates

## How to choose a date?

- Check other events you don't want to interfere with
 - when are competitor conferences?
 - check in your country / city and your continent
- Check other events in your city
 - avoid fairs or sport competitions as the accommodations are booked and more expensive)
- Check your holidays! Especially in the end there will be a lot work to do. So in the best case no long holidays away from the internet the month before the conference.

## Selection

Have a selection of dates available that you can use for choosing locations.

# Locations

Depending on the conference setup and type your needs for a location will change.

The type of location depends on:

 - the amount of attendees
 - conference tracks
 - extra rooms for workshops and child care
 - space for sponsors
 - catering

Keep in mind that you need a lot of infrastructure. You will need:
  - seat
  - projectors
  - screens
  - sound equipment
  - Wi-Fi
  - rest rooms
  - barrier-free access to everything

For conferences universities work great. They have large lecture rooms, pre-equipped with projectors, sound equipment and seating. In many cases they already have Wi-Fi too.
Sometimes you can get a better price in return for free tickets for their students.

Smaller events don't need that much space. They can also happen in the rooms of a sponsoring company or a co-working space.

If you aim to have a big conference with a lot of attendees and surrounding events consider even using a cinema or a big event space.
