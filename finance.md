# Financing

It is important to have a finance plan before starting to book and organize your conference. You should know what revenues you need to successfully run the conference.
As we are a non-profit conference all we want is to not have any losses. Everything we earn we donate or help other conferences to be realized.

## Handling finances
We are in the lucky position that we know a registered friendly society which handles the money.

I suggest to find something like this as well, find a company as sponsor which can handle the finances, or found a company / society so that you don't have to handle the finances on your private account.

## Expenses

The biggest expenses you will have are location and food. If you find a cheap location - maybe a sponsoring company - catering will be the main cost factor.

To give you some ideas about numbers here is a little example:

```
CouchDB Day    100 attendees   1 day      6.000€
JSUnconf       300 attendees   2 days    30.000€
```
