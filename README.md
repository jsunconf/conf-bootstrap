# (Tech) conference bootstrapping

Version *0.0.1*

We decided to open source our conference planing and share our experiences with you.

Each category will have a detailed description of what we can recommend and into what problems we ran.

Please also keep in mind that this is from our point of view as a non-profit organisation.

# The event

The first thing when you want to start a conference is to check if you have an audience and find a [setting](settings.md) that is realistic.

# Before the event

If you don't want to do it alone now is the time to find [like-minded people](team.md).

With these settings in mind you can start looking for a [date and location finding](location.md). You will see that finding a location is not an easy task. But the most important one before starting anything else. Without a location you can't have a conference.

With fixed date and location you can kick off several things which are hard or impossible to start before. You can now start to set up a [financing plan](finance.md). The financing could involve contacting [sponsors](sponsoring.md) (or other income like donations) and [tickets](tickets.md).

To get attention you need a [website](website.md) to provide information for your audience about your event. As you now have the amount of attendees (see [setting](settings.md)
), the location and date you should set up an insurance. It protects you and your attendees in case something bad happens, i.e. a lamp falls off the ceiling and hits an attendee. For ~400 people in an university as location the costs are around 200‚Ç¨ for 2 days (in Germany).

To run this event you need a [code of conduct](coc.md). There will be some people who say this is optional but it is not.

If you run an unconference this the very basic setup. If you run a curated conference you need a CFP and afterwards a selection process for the [curated talks](curatedTalks.md).

If you feel confident and want to provide more than the basic setup there are some other things you can add. You can offer [Contriboot‚Ñ¢](contriboot.md), [catering](catering.md), [diversity support](diversitySupport.md), [swag](swag.md), [parties](party.md), [workshops](workshops.mdÃ®) and [badges](badges.md).

This is the basic [roadmap](roadmap.md) of our unconferences. Many tasks have to get tackled sequentially, i.e. you can just order food after the ticket sale closes and you know the amount of attendees (minus the typical no-show-rate).

# The day of the event

To prevent people to join your event who haven't paid you need some sort of [access control](accessControl.md).

If you run an unconference you have to prepare and organize the [voting process](voting.md)

# After the event

Check your finances. Thank your sponsors and attendees. Get feedback.
