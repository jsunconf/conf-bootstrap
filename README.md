# (Tech) conference bootstrapping

Version *0.0.1*

We decided to open source our conference planing and share our experiences with you.

Each category will have a detailed description of what we can recommend and into what problems we ran.

Please also keep in mind that this is from our point of view as a non-profit organisation.

The most important thing after the [preparation thoughts](preparation.md) is having a date and a location. So let's focus on [date and location finding](location.md) a little bit. You can see that location finding is not an easy task. But the most important one before starting anything else. Without a location you can't start a conference.

After you found a venue and a date for your conference the next step is to have a financing plan. That means on the one hand [sponsors](sponsoring.md) (or other money income like donations) and participants.
