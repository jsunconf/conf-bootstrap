# (Tech) conference bootstrapping

Version *0.0.1*

We decided to open source our conference planing and share our experiences with you.

Each category will have a detailed description of what we can recommend and into what problems we ran.

Please also keep in mind that this is from our point of view as a non-profit organisation.

# The event

The first thing when you want to start a conference is to check if you have an audience and find a [setting](settings.md) that is realistic.

# Before the event

If you don't want to do it alone now is the time to find [like-minded people](team.md).

With these settings in mind you can start looking for a [date and location finding](location.md). You will see that finding a location is not an easy task. But the most important one before starting anything else. Without a location you can't have a conference.

After you found a venue and a date for your conference the next step is to have a [financing plan](finance.md). That means [sponsors](sponsoring.md) (or other income like donations) and [tickets](tickets.md). To get attention you need a [website](website.md) to provide information for your audience about your event.

To run this event you need a [code of conduct](coc.md). There will be some people who say this is optional but it is not.

If you run an unconference this is all you need. If you run a conference with curated talks you need a [CFP](cfp.md) and afterwards a [selection process](talkSelection.md) for the talks. Everything else is optional.

If you feel confident to provide more than the basic settings let's discuss these options. You can offer [catering](catering.md), [diversity support](diversitySupport.md), [swag](swag.md), [a party](party.md), [workshops](workshops.mdÃ®), [badges](badges.md).

Here is a basic [roadmap](roadmap.md).

# The day of the event

To prevent people to join your event who haven't paid you need some sort of [access control](accessControl.md).

If you run an unconference you have to prepare and organize the [voting process](voting.md)

# After the event

Check your finances. Thank your sponsors and attendees. Get feedback.
